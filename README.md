:small_red_triangle: **Linux Academy** - Subscription based service for many certifications, much like ITproTV. They have a lot of courses for security, Linux, and cloud. I used them for Linux Essentials. They also have labs and practice exams available. They were recently aquired by A Cloud Guru, so you must sign up through them.

:small_red_triangle: **CBT Nuggets** - Subscription based platform with many high quality instructors and courses. The price is a little on the high side, but definitely worth the investment if used often.
